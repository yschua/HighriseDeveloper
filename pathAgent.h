// When somone wants to go somewhere, just hand them over to their own personal travel agent.
// "MyPathAgent 2500 will take you to your destination quickly and safely, only 19.95 + S&H"
// The Activities Agent will hand people to this agent when they enter a travel state.
// A location and destination will be set for the person(s) preparing to embark. The path agent will
// then find the best path to that destination. Folks in the tower(s) will be transitioned from
// point to point. The nearest elevalor is found and enqueued. Should the wait time exceed A limt
// the PA will look for the another elevator close by that stops on the level desired. It found then
// the person procedes there. If time exceeds A&B limit then a moderate distance is searched. Same
// for limit C but forther. If still no satifaction, enter drastic mode( leave, move etc).
